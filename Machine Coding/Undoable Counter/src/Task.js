🔢📜 **Build a Counter with History and Undo/Redo Functionality**

Requirements:


- The counter starts at 0.

- Buttons "/2", "-1", "+1", "x2" apply their respective operations to the current count.

- A row is added to the history table showing the operation, count before the operation, and count after the operation.

- The "Undo" button undoes the last action and updates the count accordingly.

- The "Redo" button applies the last undo-ed action, if any.

-️ Clicking on any modification button clears all undo-ed actions, and they cannot be redo-ed.

- The "Reset" button resets the counter to 0 and clears all history. */
